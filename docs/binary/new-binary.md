The motivation of UnrealCV is making virtual worlds easier to create, use and share for computer vision researchers.

If you have an Unreal Engine project, you can compile UnrealCV into your project and share with other researchers. This is different from releasing an image/video dataset. Other researchers can use UnrealCV commands to generate image/video with rich ground truth and do perform many more tasks that are not available for a static dataset.
