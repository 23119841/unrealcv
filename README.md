# UnrealCV

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/qiuwch/unrealcv.svg?token=x3MJbq7z7sZyEUorGp5T&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/qiuwch/unrealcv)

UnrealCV is a project to help computer vision researchers build virtual worlds using Unreal Engine 4 (UE4). It extends UE4 with a plugin by providing:

1. A set of UnrealCV commands to interact with the virtual world.
2. Communication between UE4 and an external program, such as Caffe.

UnrealCV can be used in two ways. First, download a compiled game binary with UnrealCV embedded. This is as simple as running a game, no knowledge of Unreal Engine is required. Second, install UnrealCV plugin to Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) and use the editor of UE4 to build a new virtual world.


Please read [Tutorial: Getting Started](/tutorial/getting_started.html) to learn using UnrealCV.
